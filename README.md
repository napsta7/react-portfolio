# React Portfolio

## Description
This is my portfolio built with react, to demonstrate my different projects and my skills in web development. There is a navbar with links to the different sections, "About", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume". Please note that the back-end functionality for a user to send an email is not implemented and will be implemented later in the course.

## Credits
I used a stack overflow post to help with creating the pdf download link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/364946/how-to-make-pdf-file-downloadable-in-html-link
I also used a freecodecamp article for putting the footer at the bottom of the page:

I also used code that was corrected/supplied by the Xpert Learning Assistant.
